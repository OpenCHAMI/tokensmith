# Service Authentication Example

This example demonstrates how to implement service-to-service authentication using the tokensmith service. It shows how a service can:
1. Obtain a service token from tokensmith
2. Automatically refresh the token when needed
3. Use the token to authenticate with other services

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later
- A running tokensmith service (default: `http://localhost:8080`)
- A target service that accepts service tokens (for demonstration)

## Configuration

Before running the example, you need to:

1. Ensure the tokensmith service is running and accessible
2. Update the following constants in `main.go` if needed:
   ```go
   const (
       tokensmithURL = "http://localhost:8080" // Your tokensmith service URL
       serviceName   = "example-service"        // Your service name
       serviceID     = "example-service-1"      // Your service ID
   )
   ```
3. Update the `targetURL` in the main function to point to your target service:
   ```go
   targetURL := "http://localhost:8081/protected-endpoint"
   ```

## Running the Example

1. Navigate to the example directory:
   ```bash
   cd example/serviceauth
   ```

2. Run the example with required OpenCHAMI parameters:
   ```bash
   go run main.go --instance-id="openchami-instance-1" --cluster-id="cluster-1"
   ```

The example will:
1. Get an initial service token from tokensmith with OpenCHAMI-specific claims
2. Display the token expiration time
3. Demonstrate token refresh functionality
4. Use the token to call another service

## OpenCHAMI Integration

This example uses the `tokenservice` package from tokensmith to handle service authentication. The service tokens include OpenCHAMI-specific custom claims:

- `instance_id`: The OpenCHAMI instance identifier
- `cluster_id`: The OpenCHAMI cluster identifier
- `iss`: The tokensmith service URI as the issuer

These claims are passed via headers:
- `X-Instance-ID`: OpenCHAMI instance identifier
- `X-Cluster-ID`: OpenCHAMI cluster identifier

The tokensmith service will include these claims in the generated JWT tokens, which can be used for:
- Service identification within OpenCHAMI
- Cluster-specific authorization
- Instance-level tracking and monitoring

## Implementation Details

The example uses the `tokenservice` package from tokensmith, which provides:

1. **Service Client Creation**
   ```go
   client := tokenservice.NewServiceClient(
       tokensmithURL,
       serviceName,
       serviceID,
       instanceID,
       clusterID,
   )
   ```

2. **Token Management**
   - `GetToken()`: Obtains a new service token
   - `RefreshTokenIfNeeded()`: Automatically refreshes the token when close to expiration
   - `GetServiceToken()`: Retrieves the current service token

3. **Service Communication**
   - `CallTargetService()`: Makes authenticated requests to other services
   - Automatic token refresh before making requests
   - Proper error handling and context management

## Error Handling

The example includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing required parameters (instance-id, cluster-id)
- Token request failures
- Token refresh failures
- Service communication errors
- Invalid responses

## Security Considerations

- Tokens are automatically refreshed when they're close to expiration
- All HTTP requests use HTTPS in production (update URLs accordingly)
- Context timeouts are used to prevent hanging requests
- Service credentials are managed securely through the tokenservice package

## Integration with Your Services

To integrate this pattern into your services:

1. Import the tokenservice package:
   ```go
   import "github.com/openchami/tokensmith/pkg/tokenservice"
   ```

2. Create a service client with your configuration:
   ```go
   client := tokenservice.NewServiceClient(
       "https://your-tokensmith-service",
       "your-service-name",
       "your-service-id",
       "your-instance-id",
       "your-cluster-id",
   )
   ```

3. Use the client to make authenticated requests:
   ```go
   ctx := context.Background()
   
   // Get initial token
   if err := client.GetToken(ctx); err != nil {
       // Handle error
   }
   
   // Make authenticated request
   if err := client.CallTargetService(ctx, "https://api.example.com/protected"); err != nil {
       // Handle error
   }
   ```
